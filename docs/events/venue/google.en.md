# Google Offices
Meetups can be held at a Google office, but you'll need a Googler to host the event.  

Not all Google offices have a Googler or GDG Advocate. 

## Host
In order to meetup at Google, you must have a Googler host the meetup. 

### Find a Host
Find a host by asking [TODO].

## Scheduling
Have the host schedule a meeting room on a Google Campus.

## Badges
Have a Googler print generic badges for guests for the event. 
The Googler's name hosting the event will be on the generic badges.
Badges must be worn at all times when at the Google campus.

* In some cases the badges may be created for each guest.

## Googlers Required
Events held at Google offices require a one Googler for every ten guests.
